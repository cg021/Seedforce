/**
 * cssnano decided to make its APIs asynchronous with v4. Because the LWC compiler transform API is
 * synchronous we can't use cssnano directly. For now we use the css-nano-preset-default and filter
 * out the plugins that are async.

 *
 * We may switch back to cssnano if/when they decide to go back to a synchronous API:
